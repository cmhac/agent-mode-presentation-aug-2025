# **Part 1: Introduction**

## _What is Agent Mode?_

### ðŸ¤– From Autocomplete to Autonomous Coding

---

# What is Agent Mode?

<!-- _class: invert -->

## Definition

An AI coding assistant mode where you **describe a high-level task** and the AI autonomously plans and applies the needed code changes across your project.

> _It's more proactive than simple autocomplete._

# How Agent Mode Works

## Think of it as assigning a task to a junior developer:

- ðŸŽ¯ **Agent figures out** which files/functions to modify
- ðŸ”§ **Runs tools** (tests, build commands) to get the job done
- ðŸ”„ **Iterates** until the task is complete or needs guidance

---

# Use Cases

Agent mode is great for **larger or vague tasks** that span multiple files:

- ðŸ”„ **Refactoring**: "Use Redis for caching"
- âœ¨ **New features**: "Add OAuth login"
- ðŸ“¦ **Migrations**: "Migrate to a different framework"

The agent handles planning and editing in **all relevant places**.
