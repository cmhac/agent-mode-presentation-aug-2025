# What is Agent Mode?

<!-- _class: invert -->

An AI coding assistant mode where you **describe a high-level task** and the AI autonomously plans and applies the needed code changes across your project.

---

# Use cases

- Refactoring code (turn this block of code into a function)
- Adding a new features (add zoom boundaries to this interactive map)
- Migrating to a new framework (migrate this code from Pandas to Polars)
- Vibecoding internal tools (build me a streamlit app for data entry)
- Learning new technologies (help me understand this new API/library/etc).

# How Agent Mode Works

Agent mode can take more complex multi-step actions than tab completions or regular ChatGPT.

It has access to your entire codebase, and can run terminal commands and use various tools to see the output of our code and check for errors.
