# Documentation Standards

**SCOPE**: Monorepo infrastructure only.

**RULE**: Every infrastructure code change MUST include documentation updates.

Required files: `README.md`, `docs/USAGE.md`, `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

Standards: Clear, actionable, grounded in actual code. No hypothetical features or config duplicates.
